        <p>Pasta alla Norma is a classic Italian dish. It primarily utilizes the 
            left over vegetables at the end of the week. The medley of flavours combines
            for a truly excellent experience</p>

        <p>Here is how it's made:
            <ol>
                <li>Go to the back alley behind Vinny's house</li>
                <li>Find Vinny and ask him to see "the stuff"</li>
                <li>He will flip open his jacket and offer you a variety of pastas</li>
                <li>Grab the pasta of your preference</li>
                <li>Eyyyy Ohhhhh</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
